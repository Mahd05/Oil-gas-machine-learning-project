title: "Facies Classfication & Clustering"
description: "Understanding subsurface facies is fundamental to reservoir characterization. This project employed innovative clustering techniques to group similar geological facies, providing insights into reservoir heterogeneity. By automating facies classification, geoscientists can now interpret data faster and with greater confidence."
