title: "Oil Production Wells Events Detection Using Change Points Detection Algorithms (Scale, Cease, Slugging Sells)"
description: "In the Rumaila supergiant oil field, detecting well issues like scaling, cessation, or slugging is critical to maintaining productivity. This project employs cutting-edge change point detection techniques to break down time-series data into sub-trends, each representing a distinct phase of well behavior. By analyzing statistical properties of these sub-trends, we identified problematic patterns, enabling swift  action to maximize production uptime."
