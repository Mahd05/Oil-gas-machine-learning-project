title: "Unsupervised Production Anomaly Detection"
type: 'projects'
weight: 3
description: "Production anomalies can signal sensor errors or significant operational events. By applying advanced unsupervised techniques such as ADTK, Local Outlier Factor (LOF), and Isolation Forest, this project identified irregularities in Digital Oilfield (DOF) data. The result? Enhanced monitoring capabilities that highlight potential issues before they escalate, saving time and resources"
